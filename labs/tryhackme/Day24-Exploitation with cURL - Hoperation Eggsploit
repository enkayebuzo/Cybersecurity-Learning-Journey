## Completed Day 24 of #AdventOfCyber2025

Today’s challenge focused on **Web Exploitation using cURL**, specifically learning how to interact with web applications **without a browser or GUI tools**.

The lab simulated a real-world scenario where only a **command-line interface** is available, requiring a solid understanding of **HTTP requests, responses, sessions, and headers**.

## What I Learned
- How HTTP communication works at a low level (**GET vs POST requests**)
- Using **cURL** to send and inspect raw HTTP requests and responses
- Submitting form data and interacting with web endpoints from the terminal
- Capturing and reusing **session cookies** to maintain authenticated access
- Automating repetitive web requests using **Bash scripting**
- Understanding how brute-force attacks work behind common security tools
- Bypassing basic security controls by manipulating **HTTP headers** such as User-Agent
- Why weak authentication, poor session handling, and header-based checks are insecure

This room helped me better understand **what web exploitation tools automate behind the scenes** and why **strong fundamentals** are essential for both attackers and defenders.
